This repo tracks all new and accepted feature proposals (internal or external) for the [Temporal open source project](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal). If you're interested in submitting a proposal for consideration, please refer the [Creating a new proposal](#creating-a-new-proposal) section.

### Creating a new proposal

The Temporal proposal process begins when you create an [issue RFC](./RFC_TEMPLATE.md) on this repo. There are some general guidelines we expect all proposal contributors to follow:

* Before you submit a new proposal, please do your best to search through the repo for existing proposals that address a similar problem.
* Proposal must adhere to our [issue RFC template](./RFC_TEMPLATE.md). Reviewing proposals takes time, having a standard form of submission ensures each proposal gets a fair chance.
* It's important to explain why the proposal is important to Temporal, outside of your specific needs. Temporal is a community project and therefore we will prioritize proposals that most benefit the community.

We appreciate the time and energy it takes to create a well constructed proposal. If you ever feel that your proposal was constructed properly but not given a fair chance, please reach out to us!
